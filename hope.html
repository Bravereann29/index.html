        <h3>The importance of hope against other factors in the recovery of mental illness</h3>
        <p>Hope underpins the recovery process of mental illness, as recovery depends on the notion that a patient desires to get better. This makes hope the route by which it occurs. Here, we assess the importance of hope in recovery by exploring what recovery means; the relevance of hope and other factors in achieving it; and finally, the difficulties surrounding maintaining hope. We attempt to discuss hope in the context of recovery from three different situations; Depression, Anorexia Nervosa, and Schizophrenia, and therefore we consider what recovery means in each of these situations and hence the role of hope in each of them. The journey of recovery is an on-going, personal process, which aims to allow a person to have a satisfying life despite the limitations posed by their condition. Several factors are important in permitting it, ranging from learning how to manage one's condition, to improving self- esteem. However, the central tenet in recovery is hope- it is the catalyst for change, and the enabler of the other factors involved in recovery to take charge. Whilst problems exist in helping an individual believe in it, there exist definite routes by which it can be done, such as education and reducing stigma. Ultimately, hope is just as important in recovery from mental illness as in physical illness because hope matters in any situation - the only difference is that in mental illness, the end point is much harder to rationalize in the patient's mind because it requires an awareness that one's mental state is not fixed, the truth being that mental illnesses are not part of one's nature, but are states of mind which can be changed in many instances. Therefore, we must work even harder to ensure this belief is instilled in those suffering
               from mental illness because hope offers the means by which a better future can be perceived; and therefore, achieved.</p>

        <h2>Helping a loved one</h2>
        <p>If your loved one shows signs of mental illness, have an open and honest discussion with him or her about your concerns. You may not be able 
            to force someone to get professional care, but you can offer encouragement and support. You can also help your loved one find a qualified mental health professional
             and make an appointment. You may even be able to go along to the appointment.
            If your loved one has done self-harm or is considering doing so, take the person to the hospital or call for emergency help.

         <h3>Are Teens and Young Adults Hopeful or Hopeless Right Now?</h3>
         <p>As for young adults, a global survey of Gen Z and millennials conducted by Deloitte in late 2019 and early 2020found that this age groups levels of hopefulness for the world and their future had gone down slightly from the previous survey. After the pandemic set in, however, 
            Deloitte did a “pulse survey” of a smaller number of young adults. This time,
               not surprisingly, they found a significant drop in hope and optimism.</p>
        <h3>The Science of Hope</h3>
        <p>What defines hope, exactly? According to the “hope theory” formulated by positive psychologist Charles Snyder and his colleagues, hope gives people the will, determination, and sense of empowerment that allows them to reach their goals. A large body of research on hope demonstrates its power to support well-being,
             even more so than optimism or self-efficacy (our belief in our own abilities)</p>
        <p>A recent review of the research on hope and mental health looked at 20 studies involving college students, who suffer from high rates of depression, anxiety, and distress. The study authors synthesized the research, conducted over the last decade. Hence,
         they found five major themes regarding the role hope plays in young peoples mental health</p>
         <p>Along with improving overall mental health, hope may also play a role in healing specific conditions, including anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. A 2020 study led by Matthew Gallagher, associate professor of clinical psychology at the University of Houston, 
            looked at the link between hope and mental health treatment for anxiety.
            Gallagher and his team studied how hope impacted recovery among 223 adults who were being treated for social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The study concluded that “hope was a common element and a strong predictor of recovery,”</p>
